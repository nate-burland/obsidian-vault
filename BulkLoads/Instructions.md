  Build/choose an Azure model(s) of your choice to read and extract a specified set of fields from the included images/documents.

** Field List word document included.  
** I’ve included examples of outputs for the example documents.  
  
Goal: Return matching or higher accuracy values.

Build very basic UI to upload 1 doc/image and return very simple output of the returned values, similar to what you built for your first demo.
